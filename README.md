# screeps-arena-javascript-starter

Just some simple example code demonstrating one way to organize files and code
in JS for screeps arena to improve code reusability and maintainability across arenas.

To use this library, just download and point a given arena directory selection at the top level source folder (with main.mjs).

This library is not neccesarily meant to be used as a framework and provides no competitively useful code.  Instead it is meant simply as a reference specifically related to the intersection
of screeps and JS.

Each basic arena attempts to demonstrate some simple strategy or concept.

CTF: inheritance for generalized vs specialized creep operation

SAS: basic spawning based on populations

CAC: cost matrix usage and visualization
